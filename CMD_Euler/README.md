# CMD_Euler

Meant as a command line tool to start solving project euler math problems!  
Hopefully one day expanded to a whole suite of sweet tools to help beginer programmers.  
Written entirely in bash because.  

## Futre updates may include:
### 1. Project templates development steps:
  * Create problem directory  
  * Copy problem description into source file as a block comment (in specified language)  
  * Language support (C, CPP, Python, Bash ...)  
### 2. Formatting
  * Color support  
  * Font support  
  * Prettier spacing
